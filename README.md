# snake
Currently, the file snake.py contains the snake game using pyqt. The snake moves around the maze and can eat apples, which are counted.
Future ideas include: introduce snakes that compete for apples, a ghost that, like in pacman, chases the snake. The main idea behin it was, from a guy that used Qt4 for tetris, transform its game into a snake game.
